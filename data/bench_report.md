# Agent CFO — Benchmark Report


## Q1. Report the Net Interest Margin (NIM) over the last 5 quarters, with values, and add 1–2 lines of explanation.

**Answer**

The Net Interest Margin (NIM) over the last five quarters is as follows:

*   1Q25: 2.12% [1Q25_CFO_presentation.pdf, 1Q25, p.5, Net interest margin (NIM)]
*   4Q24: 2.15% [1Q25_CFO_presentation.pdf, 1Q25, p.5, Net interest margin (NIM)]
*   3Q24: 2.11% [1Q25_CFO_presentation.pdf, 1Q25, p.5, Net interest margin (NIM)]
*   2Q24: 2.14% [1Q25_CFO_presentation.pdf, 1Q25, p.5, Net interest margin (NIM)]
*   1Q24: 2.14% [1Q25_CFO_presentation.pdf, 1Q25, p.5, Net interest margin (NIM)]

The Group NIM declined 3 basis points in 1Q25 compared to the previous quarter, primarily due to lower interest rates [1Q25_CFO_presentation.pdf, 1Q25, p.5, Net interest margin (NIM)].

Overall, NIM has remained within a narrow range over the past five quarters.

## Q2. Show Operating Expenses (Opex) for the last 3 fiscal years, year-on-year comparison, and summarize the top 3 Opex drivers from the MD&A.

**Answer**

Operating expenses for the last 3 fiscal years are not provided in the context.

The context states that expenses for Q1 2024 were SGD 2.08 billion [1Q24_trading_update.pdf, 1Q24, p.3, Cost-to-income (CTI)]. A year-on-year comparison cannot be performed due to the absence of full fiscal year figures.

The context mentions "non-recurring items" as a factor impacting quarterly expenses [1Q24_trading_update.pdf, 1Q24, p.3, Cost-to-income (CTI)] and "sign-on bonuses" amounting to SGD 574 thousand as payments made during the Financial Year 2020 [dbs-annual-report-2020.pdf, 2020, p.46, Other provisions]. However, the provided context does not summarize the top 3 operating expense drivers from the MD&A.

The available context is insufficient to provide Opex for the last three fiscal years, year-on-year comparison, or the top 3 Opex drivers from MD&A.

## Q3. Calculate the Cost-to-Income Ratio (CTI) for the last 3 fiscal years; show your working and give 1–2 lines of implications.

**Answer**

I cannot calculate the Cost-to-Income Ratio (CTI) for the last three fiscal years as the provided context does not contain the necessary figures for Cost and Income, nor does it explicitly state the CTI for any specific year. The passage mentioning "Cost-to-income (CTI)" provides a qualitative discussion rather than numerical data [dbs-annual-report-2020.pdf, 2020, p.12, Cost-to-income (CTI)].

The required figures are not available in the provided context.
