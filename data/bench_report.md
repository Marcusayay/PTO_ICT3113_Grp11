# Agent CFO — Benchmark Report


## Q1. Report the Net Interest Margin (NIM) over the last 5 quarters, with values, and add 1–2 lines of explanation.

**Answer**

The Net Interest Margin (NIM) for the last five quarters is as follows:

*   1Q25: 2.12% [1Q25_CFO_presentation.pdf, 1Q25, p.5, Net interest margin (NIM)]
*   4Q24: 2.15% [1Q25_CFO_presentation.pdf, 1Q25, p.5, Net interest margin (NIM)]
*   3Q24: 2.11% [1Q25_CFO_presentation.pdf, 1Q25, p.5, Net interest margin (NIM)]
*   2Q24: 2.14% [1Q25_CFO_presentation.pdf, 1Q25, p.5, Net interest margin (NIM)]
*   1Q24: 2.14% [1Q25_CFO_presentation.pdf, 1Q25, p.5, Net interest margin (NIM)]

The NIM in 1Q25 declined by 3 basis points quarter-on-quarter, primarily due to lower interest rates [1Q25_CFO_presentation.pdf, 1Q25, p.5, Net interest margin (NIM)].

The NIM has fluctuated slightly over the past five quarters, with a recent decline attributed to lower interest rates.

## Q2. Show Operating Expenses (Opex) for the last 3 fiscal years, year-on-year comparison, and summarize the top 3 Opex drivers from the MD&A.

**Answer**

Agent CFO is unable to provide Operating Expenses (Opex) for the last 3 fiscal years or a year-on-year comparison, as this information is not available in the provided context.

Additionally, the provided context does not contain a summary of the top 3 Opex drivers from a Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) section. One mention of expenses notes "Expenses of SGD 2.08 billion were 6% lower than the previous quarter, which had included non-recurring items" [1Q24_trading_update.pdf, 1Q24, p.3, Cost-to-income (CTI)], but this does not detail top Opex drivers.

**Takeaway:** Comprehensive Opex data and its drivers for multiple fiscal years are not present in the given documents.

## Q3. Calculate the Cost-to-Income Ratio (CTI) for the last 3 fiscal years; show your working and give 1–2 lines of implications.

**Answer**

I am unable to calculate the Cost-to-Income Ratio (CTI) for the last 3 fiscal years as the provided context does not contain the necessary numerical figures for CTI, total income, or total costs for any fiscal year [dbs-annual-report-2020.pdf, 2020, p.12, Cost-to-income (CTI); p.193; p.194].

Therefore, no calculations or implications can be provided.
