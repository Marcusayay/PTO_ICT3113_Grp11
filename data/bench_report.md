# Agent CFO — Benchmark Report


## Q1. Report the Net Interest Margin (NIM) over the last 5 quarters, with values, and add 1–2 lines of explanation.

**Answer**

The Net Interest Margin (NIM) over the last five quarters is as follows:

*   **1Q25**: 2.12% [1Q25_CFO_presentation.pdf, 1Q25, p.5, NIM table]
*   **4Q24**: 2.15% [1Q25_CFO_presentation.pdf, 1Q25, p.5, NIM table]
*   **3Q24**: 2.11% [1Q25_CFO_presentation.pdf, 1Q25, p.5, NIM table]
*   **2Q24**: 2.14% [1Q25_CFO_presentation.pdf, 1Q25, p.5, NIM table]
*   **1Q24**: 2.14% [1Q25_CFO_presentation.pdf, 1Q25, p.5, NIM table]

The Group NIM for 1Q25 declined by 3 basis points from the previous quarter, attributed to lower interest rates [1Q25_CFO_presentation.pdf, 1Q25, p.5, NIM table]. Over these five quarters, the NIM has fluctuated within a narrow range between 2.11% and 2.15%.

Net Interest Margin has shown some fluctuation over the last five reported quarters, with a recent decline attributed to lower interest rates.

## Q2. Show Operating Expenses (Opex) for the last 3 fiscal years, year-on-year comparison, and summarize the top 3 Opex drivers from the MD&A.

**Answer**

Agent CFO here.

Operating Expenses (Opex) figures for the last three fiscal years are not provided in the context. Therefore, a year-on-year comparison cannot be performed.

Based on the MD&A, the following Opex drivers were identified:
1.  **Increased cyber security risk** arising from the significant increase of staff working from home [dbs-annual-report-2020.pdf, 2020, p.25, Cost-to-income (CTI)].
2.  **Investments for the future** which the board advised management to continue making [dbs-annual-report-2020.pdf, 2020, p.25, Cost-to-income (CTI)].
3.  **Sign-on bonuses**, which totaled SGD 574,000 during the financial year [dbs-annual-report-2020.pdf, 2020, p.46, Allowances / Credit costs].

Takeaway: Specific Opex figures are not available, but key drivers include cybersecurity, future investments, and sign-on bonuses.

## Q3. Calculate the Cost-to-Income Ratio (CTI) for the last 3 fiscal years; show your working and give 1–2 lines of implications.

**Answer**

I cannot calculate the Cost-to-Income Ratio (CTI) for the last 3 fiscal years as the necessary "Cost" and "Income" figures are not available in the provided context. The context passages primarily contain information regarding corporate governance, resolutions, and proxy form details.
