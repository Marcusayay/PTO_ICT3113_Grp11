Materiality,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
The scope of our audit was,influenced by,our a,pplication of m,aterialit,y. An audit,is design,ed to obtain
reasonable assurance as t,o whether th,e con,solidated finan,cial stat,ements ar,e free fro,m material
misstatement. Misstateme,nts may aris,e due,to fraud or e,rror. Th,ey are co,nsidered,"material if,"
individually or in aggregat,"e, they could r",eason,ably be expecte,d to infl,uence the e,conomic,decisions of
users taken on the basis of,the consolidat,ed fin,ancial stateme,nts.,,,
,,,,,,,
Based on our professional,"judgement, w",e dete,rmined certain,quantit,ative thres,holds for,"materiality,"
including the overall group,materiality fo,r the,consolidated fi,nancial s,tatements,as a whol,"e, as set out"
"in the table below. These, t",ogether with q,ualita,tive considerat,"ions, hel",ped us to d,etermine,the scope of
"our audit and the nature,",timing and e,xtent,of our audit p,rocedure,s and to e,valuate t,he effect of
"misstatements, both indivi",dually and on,the fi,nancial stateme,nts as a,whole.,,

How we determined over,all 5% of t,he Gr,oup’s profit bef,ore tax,,,
Group materiality,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Rationale for benchmark, We,chos,e ‘profit before,"tax’ as, i","n our view,",it is the b,enchmark
applied,ag,ainst w,hich performa,nce of th,e Group is,most com,monly
,me,asure,d.,,,,
, We,selec,ted 5% based o,n our pr,ofessional j,udgemen,"t, noting"
,tha,t it is,also within the,range of,commonl,y accepted,profit-
,rel,ated t,hresholds.,,,,
,,,,,,,
"In performing our audit,",we allocated,mater,iality levels to,the sig,nificant co,mponents,and other
components of the Group.,These are less,than,the overall Gro,up mater,iality.,,
,,,,,,,
How we developed the aud,it scope,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
We tailored the scope of ou,r audit in orde,r to pe,rform sufficien,t work to,enable us,to provide,an opinion
on the financial statements,"as a whole, t",aking,into account th,e structu,re of the G,"roup, the",accounting
"processes and controls, an",d the industry,in wh,ich the Group o,perates.,The Group,'s financi,al reporting
process is dependent on it,s Information,Techn,ology (“IT”) sy,stems. O,ur audit s,cope inclu,ded testing
the operating effectiveness,of the control,s over,the integrity of,key fina,ncial data p,rocessed,through the
IT systems that are relevan,t to financial r,eport,ing.,,,,
,,,,,,,
In establishing the overall,Group audit a,pproa,"ch, we determ",ined the,extent of,audit proc,edures that
were needed to be perform,ed across the,Group,by us or by ot,her PwC,network fi,"rms, oper",ating under
"our instruction, who are fa",miliar with th,e loca,l laws and regu,lations i,n each res,pective te,"rritory, (the"
“component auditors”). W,here the work,was,performed by c,ompone,nt auditor,"s, we dete",rmined the
level of involvement we nee,ded to have in,the p,rocedures to b,e able to,conclude w,hether su,fficient and
appropriate audit evidence,had been obt,ained,as a basis for o,ur opinio,n on the fi,nancial st,atements as
a whole.,,,,,,,
