Responsibilities of Manage,ment and Dir,ectors for,the Financial State,ments,,
,,,,,,
Management is responsible for,the preparation,of financia,l statements that give,a true and,,fair view in
accordance with the provisions,of the Act and,"SFRS(I)s, a",nd for devising and ma,intaining,,a system of
internal accounting controls su,fficient to prov,ide a reason,able assurance that a,ssets are,s,afeguarded
against loss from unauthorised,use or disposit,ion; and tra,nsactions are properl,y authori,se,d and that
they are recorded as necessary,to permit the p,reparation,of true and fair financ,ial statem,e,nts and to
maintain accountability of asse,ts.,,,,,
,,,,,,
In preparing the financial state,"ments, manage",ment is res,ponsible for assessing,the Grou,p’,s ability to
"continue as a going concern, di","sclosing, as app","licable, mat",ters related to going c,oncern a,n,d using the
going concern basis of accounti,ng unless mana,gement eith,er intends to liquidate,the Grou,p,or to cease
"operations, or has no realistic a",lternative but t,o do so.,,,,

Auditor’s Responsibilities f,or the Audit,of the Fina,ncial Statements,,,
,,,,,,
Our objectives are to obtain re,asonable assura,nce about w,hether the financial s,tatement,s,as a whole
are free from material misstate,"ment, whether d",ue to fraud,"or error, and to issue a",n auditor’,s,report that
includes our opinion. Reasonab,le assurance is,a high level,"of assurance, but is no",t a guara,n,tee that an
audit conducted in accordance,with SSAs will,always det,ect a material misstat,ement wh,e,n it exists.
Misstatements can arise from,fraud or error,and are co,"nsidered material if, i",ndividual,l,y or in the
"aggregate, they could reasonabl",y be expected t,o influence t,he economic decisions,of users,ta,ken on the
basis of these financial stateme,nts.,,,,,
,,,,,,
As part of an audit in accord,ance with SSA,"s, we exerc",ise professional judg,ement a,nd,maintain
professional scepticism through,out the audit.,We also:,,,,
,,,,,,
 Identify and assess the risk,s of material m,isstatement,of the financial state,"ments, wh",e,ther due to
"fraud or error, design and",perform audit,procedures,responsive to those ri,"sks, and",o,btain audit
evidence that is sufficient,and appropria,te to provid,e a basis for our opi,nion. Th,e,risk of not
detecting a material missta,tement resultin,g from frau,d is higher than for one,resultin,g,"from error,"
as fraud may involve collus,"ion, forgery, int",entional om,"issions, misrepresent","ations, or",t,he override
of internal control.,,,,,,
 Obtain an understanding of,internal contro,l relevant to,the audit in order to de,sign audi,t,procedures
that are appropriate in the,"circumstances,",but not for,the purpose of express,ing an op,i,nion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s,internal contro,l.,,,,
