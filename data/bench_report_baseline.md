## Q1. Report the Net Interest Margin (NIM) over the last 5 quarters, with values, and add 1–2 lines of explanation.

**Answer**

The Net Interest Margin (NIM) over the last 5 quarters is as follows:

*   2Q25: 2.05%
*   1Q25: 2.12%
*   4Q24: 2.15%
*   3Q24: 2.11%
*   2Q24: 2.14%
(Source: [2Q25_CFO_presentation.pdf, p.6])

For 4Q24, the group's NIM increased by 4 basis points quarter-on-quarter. This was attributed to higher markets trading more than offsetting a lower commercial book [4Q24_CFO_presentation.pdf, p.6].

## Q2. Show Operating Expenses (Opex) for the last 3 fiscal years, year-on-year comparison, and summarize the top 3 Opex drivers from the MD&A.

**Answer**

Agent CFO here. Based **ONLY** on the provided context:

Operating Expenses (Opex) for the last 3 fiscal years and their year-on-year comparison cannot be provided, as the provided context does not contain these specific figures. The context mentions expenses for 1Q24 (SGD 2.08 billion) and a 10% year-on-year increase for expenses in 1Q24, but not full fiscal year data for the last three years [1Q24, p.3].

From the provided text, the top Opex drivers identified are:

1.  **Consolidation of Citi Taiwan**: This acquisition accounted for five percentage points of the 10% increase in expenses year-on-year for 1Q24 [1Q24, p.3, NIM table].
2.  **Non-recurring items**: The expenses for 1Q24 were 6% lower than the previous quarter, which had "included non-recurring items," indicating these items were a driver for higher expenses in the prior period [1Q24, p.3].

## Q3. Calculate the Cost-to-Income Ratio (CTI) for the last 3 fiscal years; show your working and give 1–2 lines of implications.

**Answer**

Agent CFO here.

Based on the provided context, I am unable to calculate the Cost-to-Income Ratio (CTI) for the last 3 fiscal years. The context only contains information regarding directors' remuneration for FY2020 and some comparative details for FY2021 [dbs-annual-report-2020.pdf, 2020, p.193], [dbs-annual-report-2021.pdf, 2021, p.31]. It does not provide the necessary total operating cost and total income figures required for the CTI calculation.
