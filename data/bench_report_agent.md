# Agent CFO — Agent Benchmark Report


---

## Q1. Report the Net Interest Margin (NIM) over the last 5 quarters, with values, and add 1–2 lines of explanation.

**Answer**

I am sorry, but I cannot fulfill this request. The tool execution log indicates that there were errors when attempting to calculate the Net Interest Margin (NIM) for the last five quarters, specifically "Error: Invalid characters." This suggests that the necessary financial data could not be processed, and therefore, I cannot report the NIM values or provide an explanation.

## Q2. Show Operating Expenses (Opex) for the last 3 fiscal years, year-on-year comparison, and summarize the top 3 Opex drivers from the MD&A.

**Answer**

I am sorry, but I cannot fulfill your request with the provided information.

Here's why:
*   **Operating Expenses for the last 3 fiscal years:** The `table_extraction` tool calls for the latest fiscal year, the prior fiscal year, and two years prior did not return numerical operating expense data. Instead, they returned unrelated text about share purchase mandates and employee share plans.
*   **Year-on-year comparison:** Due to the failure in extracting the numerical operating expense data, the `calculator` tool returned "Error: Invalid characters" for both year-on-year calculations.
*   **Top 3 Opex drivers from the MD&A:** The `table_extraction` tool call for this query returned a table of contents from a 2020 annual report, not the top 3 operating expense drivers from the MD&A section.

## Q3. Calculate the Cost-to-Income Ratio (CTI) for the last 3 fiscal years; show your working and give 1–2 lines of implications.

**Answer**

I am unable to calculate the Cost-to-Income Ratio (CTI) for the last three fiscal years or provide implications. The tool execution log indicates that the necessary financial data (Operating Expenses and Total Income) could not be extracted or processed, leading to "Error: Invalid characters" during calculation attempts for all fiscal years. Additionally, the final step to present the results and implications failed because the 'tool_code' was not found.
