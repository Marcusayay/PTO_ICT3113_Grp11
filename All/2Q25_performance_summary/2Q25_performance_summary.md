### **First Half**

First-half net profit of \$5.72 billion was little changed from a year ago despite heightened macroeconomic uncertainty, sharp declines in Sora and Hibor, significant currency fluctuations, and the implementation of the 15% global minimum tax. Total income rose 5% to a new high of \$11.6 billion. Net interest income was higher as strong deposit growth and balance sheet hedging more than offset the impact of lower interest rates. Fee income and treasury customer sales reached record levels led by growth in wealth management, while markets trading performance strengthened. The cost-income ratio was stable at 39%. Asset quality remained resilient with specific allowances at 12 basis points of loans. Return on equity was 17.0% and return on tangible equity was 18.8%.

Commercial book net interest income was 1% lower at \$7.34 billion. Net interest margin declined 19 basis points to 2.61%, reflecting US Fed rate cuts and lower Sora and Hibor. The impact of lower interest rates was mitigated by balance sheet hedging and mostly offset by balance sheet growth. Over the first half, loans grew 3% or \$12 billion in constant-currency terms, driven by non-trade corporate loans. Deposits increased 5% or \$29 billion in constantcurrency terms to \$574 billion, with more than half of the increase from Casa. Surplus deposits were deployed into liquid assets. This was accretive to net interest income and return on equity but modestly reduced net interest margin.

Commercial book net fee income rose 17% to \$2.44 billion, led by a 30% increase in wealth management fees. Loanrelated fees rose 11% to a record \$412 million. Investment banking and transaction service fees were also higher.

Commercial book other non-interest income declined 3% to \$1.07 billion. Excluding non-recurring items in the first half of 2024, it grew 11% from stronger treasury customer sales.

Markets trading income increased 80% to \$781 million, reflecting lower funding costs and a more conducive trading environment.

Expenses rose 5% to \$4.48 billion led by higher staff costs. The cost-income ratio was stable 39%.

Profit before allowances increased 5% to \$7.15 billion and profit before tax rose 3% to \$6.83 billion, with both reaching new highs.

### **Second Quarter**

Second-quarter net profit was 1% higher than a year ago at \$2.82 billion, with return on equity at 16.7% and return on tangible equity at 18.5%. Total income rose 5% to \$5.73 billion from broad-based growth. Net interest income was higher, while fee income and treasury customer sales rose to their second highest quarterly levels. Markets trading performance also strengthened. The cost-income ratio was stable at 40%. Profit before tax rose 5% to \$3.39 billion. Compared to the previous quarter, profit before tax and net profit were 1% and 3% lower respectively.

Commercial book net interest income fell 4% to \$3.63 billion. Net interest margin declined 28 basis points to 2.55% from lower interest rates, with the impact softened by balance sheet hedging. The decline in net interest income was further moderated by balance sheet growth. Loans and deposits grew 4% and 7% in constant-currency terms respectively. Compared to the previous quarter, commercial book net interest income declined 3% as net interest margin narrowed 13 basis points. Loans rose 1% or \$5 billion in constant-currency terms, led by a \$3 billion growth in non-trade corporate loans. Deposits increased 2% or \$11 billion in constant-currency terms from growth in both fixed deposits and Casa.

Commercial book net fee income rose 11% from a year ago to \$1.17 billion. The increase was largely due to a 25% rise in wealth management fees to \$649 million. Investment banking fees were also higher. Compared to the previous quarter, net fee income fell 8% as wealth management and loan-related fees eased from record levels.

Commercial book other non-interest income increased 9% to \$522 million. Excluding non-recurring items a year ago, it rose 18% from stronger treasury customer sales. Compared to the previous quarter, it declined 5% due to a moderation in treasury customer sales from a record first quarter.

Markets trading income of \$418 million was more than double the level a year ago and 15% higher than the previous quarter.

Expenses rose 5% from a year ago to \$2.27 billion led by higher staff costs, and increased 3% over the previous quarter on higher non-staff costs.

Profit before allowances was \$3.46 billion, 5% higher than a year ago and 6% lower than the previous quarter's record.

#### **Balance Sheet**

Asset quality remained resilient. The non-performing loan ratio improved from 1.1% to 1.0% over the six months, as new non-performing asset formation was low and more than offset by upgrades, repayments and write-offs.

First-half specific allowances amounted to \$270 million or 12 basis points of loans. General allowances of \$188 million were taken, including \$205 million set aside in the first quarter as a prudent measure to strengthen GP reserves in view of heightened macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Total allowance reserves amounted to \$6.44 billion, resulting in an allowance coverage of 137% and of 236% after considering collateral.

Liquidity and capital remained healthy. The liquidity coverage ratio was at 147% and the net stable funding ratio was at 114%. The reported Common Equity Tier-1 ratio was 17.0% based on transitional arrangements, and the pro-forma ratio on a fully phased-in basis was 15.1%. The leverage ratio was 6.5%. All of these ratios were comfortably above regulatory requirements.

#### Notes:

First-half net interest income rose 3% from a year ago to \$7.33 billion as lower commercial book net interest income was more than offset by higher markets trading net interest income. Commercial book net interest income was 1% lower at \$7.34 billion. Net interest margin declined 19 basis points to 2.61%, reflecting US Fed rate cuts and lower Sora and Hibor. The impact of lower interest rates was mitigated by balance sheet hedging and mostly offset by balance

sheet growth. Markets trading net interest income improved, supported by lower funding costs.

Compared to the previous half-year, net interest income was stable as balance sheet growth offset the impact of a five-basis-point decline in net interest margin to 2.08%.

<sup>1</sup> Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-bearing assets.

<sup>2</sup> Includes non-restricted balances with central banks

#### Notes:

- 2 Net of interchange fees paid

First-half net fee income rose 17% from a year ago to a record \$2.44 billion. Wealth management fees grew 30% to \$1.37 billion from broad-based demand for investment products and bancassurance. Loan-related fees grew 11% to \$412 million on strong deal activity, particularly in the first quarter. Investment banking fees rose 27% to \$47 million from increased debt and equity capital market activity. Transaction service fees were also higher, rising

2% to \$467 million. These gains were moderated by a 2% decline in card fees to \$599 million.

Compared to the previous half-year, net fee income grew 18%, led by strong increases in wealth management and loan-related fees.

First-half other non-interest income rose 1% from a year ago to \$1.87 billion. Net trading income was 1% lower at \$1.72 billion due to non-recurring gains a year ago. Excluding these gains, net trading income increased 8%, driven by record treasury customer sales and stronger markets trading performance. Gains on investment securities were also higher.

Compared to the previous half, which included property disposal gains, other non-interest income was 1% higher. The increase was driven by stronger net trading income and gains from investment securities.

Notes:

1 Excludes impact arising from Citi Integration and Provision for CSR

2 Measured based on full-time equivalent

First-half expenses increased 5% from a year ago to \$4.48 billion led by higher staff costs. Staff costs rose 7% from salary increments and higher bonus accruals. Headcount was stable. Non-staff costs increased 3% from higher computerisation and revenue-related expenses.

Compared to the previous half, expenses fell 3% due to lower non-staff costs.

The cost-income ratio was at 39%, unchanged from a year ago and three percentage points lower than the previous half.

Notes:

1 SP for loans by geography are determined according to the location where the borrower is incorporated NM Not Meaningful

First-half specific allowances for loans were higher than a year ago but remained low at \$267 million or 12 basis points of loans as asset quality remained resilient. Compared to the previous half, they were 28% lower.

General allowances of \$188 million were taken in the first half, higher than a year ago due to \$205 million set aside in the first quarter as a prudent measure to strengthen GP reserves.

Total allowances amounted to \$458 million, 62% higher than a year ago and 35% above the previous half.

The business segment results are prepared based on the Group's internal management reporting, which reflects its management structure. As the activities of the Group are highly integrated, internal allocations have been made in preparing the segment information. Amounts for each business segment are shown after the allocation of certain centralised costs, funding income and the application of transfer pricing, where appropriate. Transactions between segments are recorded within the segment as if they are third party transactions and are eliminated on consolidation.

The various business segments are described below:

The Group's performance by geography includes net revenues and expenses from internal and external counterparties. The performance by geography is classified based on the location in which income and assets are recorded, while some items such as centrally-managed credit allowances and technology-related services are reflected in Singapore. Hong Kong comprises mainly DBS Bank (HK) Limited and DBS HK branch. Rest of Greater China comprises mainly DBS Bank (China) Ltd, DBS Bank (Taiwan) Ltd and DBS Taipei branch and DBS Securities (China) Co., Ltd. South and Southeast Asia comprises mainly PT Bank DBS Indonesia, DBS Bank India Ltd, DBS Labuan branch, DBS Vietnam branch and DBS Gift City branch. All results are prepared in accordance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International).

#### **Singapore**

First-half net profit declined 5% from a year ago to \$4.02 billion due to higher tax expenses from the implementation of the 15% global minimum tax. Total income increased 4% to \$7.43 billion. Net interest income grew 5% to \$4.88 billion as balance sheet growth more than offset a decline in net interest margin. Net fee income grew 16% to \$1.45 billion led by wealth management and loan-related fees. Other non-interest income fell 14% to \$1.11 billion.

Excluding non-recurring items a year ago, other noninterest income declined 4% from lower trading gains. Expenses increased 7% to \$2.64 billion mainly from higher staff costs. Total allowances increased from a \$24 million write-back to a \$80 million charge as general allowance reserves were strengthened in the first quarter of 2025.

Compared to the previous half year, net profit decreased 5% due to higher tax expenses. Profit before tax increased 1% to \$4.72 billion, driven by a 1% rise in total income and a 2% decline in expenses, partially offset by higher total allowances.

### **Hong Kong**

The first-half results incorporated a 2% depreciation of the Hong Kong dollar against the Singapore dollar compared to a year ago.

First-half net profit of \$871 million was 9% higher than a year ago as total income rose 6% to \$1.78 billion. Net interest income fell 3% to \$1.01 billion as net interest margin declined five basis points to 1.75% from lower Hibor. The decline was more than offset by double-digit growth in net fee income and other non-interest income. Net fee income rose 23% to \$505 million led by wealth

management. Other non-interest income grew 15% to \$268 million from higher treasury customer sales and trading gains. Expenses increased 2% to \$636 million from higher staff costs. Total allowances increased 14% to \$106 million as an increase in specific allowances was partially offset by lower general allowances.

Compared to the previous half-year, net profit rose 9%. Total income rose 4% while expenses declined 9%, resulting in a 13% increase in profit before allowances to \$1.14 billion. The increase was partially offset by higher total allowances.

#### **Rest of Greater China**

First-half net profit rose 44% from a year ago to \$438 million. Total income increased 10% to \$1.12 billion led by higher fee income from Taiwan as well as stronger trading and treasury customer sales in China. Expenses were little changed at \$652 million, resulting in a 25% increase in profit before allowances to \$463 million. Total allowances halved to \$53 million mainly due to lower general allowances. Share of profits of associates increased 27% to \$127 million led by Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank.

Net profit rose 85% from the previous half year. Total income increased 16% from stronger fees and other noninterest income. Expenses declined 3%. Total allowances halved largely due to lower specific allowances in Mainland China.

### **South and Southeast Asia**

First-half net profit rose 24% from a year ago to \$254 million. Total income grew 15% to \$897 million mainly due to higher trading income and gains on investment securities in India. Expenses rose 5% to \$474 million, resulting in a 28% increase in profit before allowances to \$423 million. Total allowances increased 31% to \$93 million from higher specific allowances.

Compared to the previous half-year, net profit grew 67% driven by higher total income as well as decreases in expenses and total allowances.

#### **Rest of the World**

First-half net profit fell 37% from a year ago to \$134 million. Total income grew 3% to \$420 million as increases in net interest income and fee income were moderated by a decline in other non-interest income. Expenses were 15% higher at \$83 million. Total allowances increased from \$39 million to \$126 million due to higher specific allowances.

Compared to the previous half-year, net profit fell 42% as a decline in total income and higher allowances more than offset a reduction in expenses.

Notes:

Gross customer loans rose 4% or \$19 billion in constantcurrency terms from a year ago to \$439 billion, led by nontrade corporate loans from broad-based growth across industries. Trade loans and non-housing consumer loans were also higher, while housing loans were stable.

Over the first six months, loans grew 3% or \$12 billion in constant-currency terms driven by non-trade corporate loans.

<sup>1</sup> Loans by geography are determined according to the location where the borrower, or the issuing bank in the case of bank backed export financing, is incorporated

Asset quality continued to be resilient. Total nonperforming assets declined 7% over the six months to \$4.69 billion as new non-performing asset formation was low and more than offset by upgrades, repayments and write-offs. The NPL ratio improved from 1.1% to 1.0%.

General allowance reserves increased to \$4.11 billion due to the prudent setting aside of allowances in the first quarter against heightened macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Total allowance reserves amounted to \$6.44 billion, resulting in an allowance coverage of 137% and of 236% after considering collateral.
