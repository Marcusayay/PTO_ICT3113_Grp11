Commercial book net interest income increased 5% from a year ago to SGD 3.77 billion as net interest margin improved two basis points to 2.83%, while loans and deposits grew 3% and 6% in constant-currency terms respectively bolstered by the consolidation of Citi Taiwan.

Commercial book net fee income rose 27% from a year ago to a record SGD 1.05 billion. Wealth management fees grew 37% to SGD 518 million driven by a shift from deposits into investments and bancassurance as well as an expansion in assets

While recent market volatility and ongoing geopolitical tensions have resulted in heightened uncertainty, we have built resilience against the risks of an economic slowdown and lower interest rates. Our high general allowance reserves, reduced interest rate sensitivity, strong capital position and ample liquidity will position us to continue supporting customers and delivering shareholder returns."
