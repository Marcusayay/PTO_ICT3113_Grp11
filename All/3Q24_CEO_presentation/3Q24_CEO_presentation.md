## **CEO observations**

**DBS Group Holdings 3Q 2024 financial results November 7, 2024**

## **Another record quarterly and nine-month performance**

- **Group NII stable QoQ as balance sheet growth offset lower NIM**
  - o Commercial book NIM unchanged, supported by reduced interest rate sensitivity
  - o Lower Group NIM due to markets trading's deployment in products with inherent accounting asymmetry which are accretive to income but dilutive to NIM
- **Fee income reaches new high**
  - o Strong momentum in wealth management
- **Highest markets trading income in ten quarters, capitalised on market volatility**
- **Cost-income ratio stable at 39%**
- **Asset quality resilient, NPL ratio lower**
  - o Repayments, recoveries and write-offs more than offset new NPA formation
- **New share buyback programme another affirmation of commitment to capital management, underpinned by strong capital position and earnings generation**
