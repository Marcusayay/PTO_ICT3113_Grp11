#### Notes:

- 1 Excludes Markets trading income
- 2 "Treasury Markets" was renamed "Global Financial Markets" (GFM) as part of a business reorganisation in first-quarter 2024. "Markets trading income" comprises the market-making and trading activities of GFM. It excludes customer sales income, which is reflected in the Consumer Banking/Wealth Management and Institutional business segments under Commercial book
- 3 Income from perpetual securities, which have stated coupon rates, was reclassified from Markets Trading non-interest income to Markets Trading net interest income with effect from first-quarter 2024 to better align the income of these securities with its associated funding. The reclassification has been applied prospectively. For first-half 2024, \$110 million was reclassified, and the impact to 1H24 Group NIM was +1.6 basis points. The comparative amounts of \$119 million for first-half 2023 and \$118 million for second-half 2023 continued to be classified as Markets Trading noninterest income
- 4 Refers to expected credit loss
- 5 Refers to Citibank Taiwan integration costs and accounting harmonisation, net of tax
- 6 Refers to provision for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) commitment to DBS Foundation and other charitable causes
- 7 Excludes impact arising from Citi Integration and provision for CSR
- 8 Return on assets, return on equity, ECL Stage 3 (SP) for loans/average loans and per share data are computed on an annualised basis
- 9 Calculated based on net profit attributable to the shareholders net of dividends on other equity instruments
- 10 Non-controlling interests and other equity instruments are not included as equity in the computation
- 11 The weighted average number of ordinary shares used for per share data computation have been adjusted retrospectively for the 258 million bonus shares issued on 26 April 2024 as if the bonus issue had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented

### **First Half**

First-half net profit rose 9% from a year ago to a new high of \$5.76 billion. Total income increased 11% to \$11.0 billion, driven by broad-based growth in net interest income, fee income, and treasury customer sales. The cost-income ratio was at 39%. Asset quality remained resilient with specific allowances at nine basis points of loans. Return on equity was at 18.8%, near record levels.

Commercial book net interest income rose 6% to \$7.42 billion. Net interest margin increased five basis points to 2.80% from higher interest rates. Loans grew 1% or \$5 billion in constant-currency terms over the first half to \$425 billion, led by trade loans and non-trade corporate loans. Deposits increased 2% or \$9 billion in constantcurrency terms to \$551 billion. Casa outflows, which slowed from the previous year, were offset by an increase in fixed deposits.

Commercial book net fee income increased 25% to \$2.09 billion, led by double-digit percentage growth in wealth management fees, card fees and loan-related fees.

Commercial book other non-interest income rose 23% to \$1.10 billion. Excluding non-recurring gains, it increased 12% as treasury customer sales reached a new high.

Markets trading income was little changed at \$433 million.

Expenses rose 11% to \$4.25 billion, with Citi Taiwan accounting for five percentage points of the increase. Compared to the previous half, expenses were little changed. The cost-income ratio was at 39%.

Profit before allowances increased 10% to a record \$6.79 billion.

Including one-time integration costs of \$19 million for Citi Taiwan, first-half net profit amounted to \$5.74 billion.

### **Second Quarter**

Second-quarter net profit rose 4% from a year ago to \$2.80 billion, with return on equity at 18.2%. Total income increased 9% to \$5.48 billion. Commercial book net interest income was higher due to balance sheet growth and a slightly higher net interest margin, fee income was at a record, and treasury customer sales remained strong. Markets trading income was also higher. The cost-income ratio was at 40%. Compared to the previous quarter's record, net profit was 5% lower.

Commercial book net interest income increased 5% from a year ago to \$3.77 billion as net interest margin rose two basis points to 2.83%, while loans and deposits grew 3% and 6% in constant-currency terms respectively, bolstered by the consolidation of Citi Taiwan. Compared to the previous quarter, net interest income rose 3% as net interest margin increased six basis points led by fixed-rate asset repricing. Loans were stable in constant-currency terms as growth in trade loans and wealth management loans offset a decline in non-trade corporate loans. Deposits were

also stable in constant-currency terms, with Casa and fixed deposits little changed.

Commercial book net fee income rose 27% from a year ago to a record \$1.05 billion. Wealth management fees grew 37% to \$518 million driven by a shift from deposits into investments and bancassurance as well as an expansion in assets under management. Card fees increased 32% to \$313 million from higher spending. The consolidation of Citi Taiwan benefited wealth management and card fees. Loan-related fees were also higher, rising 40% to \$186 million. Compared to the previous quarter, net fee income was slightly higher.

Commercial book other non-interest income rose 3% from a year ago to \$478 million, driven by strong treasury customer sales. Excluding non-recurring gains, it was 15% lower than the previous quarter.

Markets trading income of \$187 million was 6% higher than a year ago and 24% lower compared to the previous quarter.

Expenses rose 12% from a year ago to \$2.17 billion, with Citi Taiwan accounting for five percentage points of the increase. Compared to the previous quarter, expenses rose 4% led by higher staff costs. The costincome ratio was at 40%.

Profit before allowances was \$3.31 billion, 6% higher than a year ago and 5% lower than the previous quarter's record.

### **Balance Sheet**

Asset quality was resilient. The NPL ratio was unchanged at 1.1% over the six months as new non-performing asset formation was offset by repayments and write-offs. Firsthalf specific allowances amounted to \$210 million or nine basis points of loans, while general allowances of \$73 million were set aside. Total allowance reserves amounted to \$6.55 billion, resulting in an allowance coverage of 129% and of 227% after considering collateral.

Liquidity and capital remained healthy. The liquidity coverage ratio was at 148% and the net stable funding ratio was at 116%. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was at 14.8% while the leverage ratio was at 6.5%. All of these ratios were comfortably above regulatory requirements.

#### Notes:

- 1 Excludes Markets Trading
- 2 Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-bearing assets
- 3 Includes non-restricted balances with central bank

First-half net interest income rose 6% from a year ago to \$7.10 billion, driven by the commercial book. The increase in commercial book net interest income was due to asset growth and a five-basis point rise in net interest margin to 2.80% from higher interest rates. Markets trading net interest income was lower due to higher funding costs.

Compared to the previous half-year, net interest income increased 2% from asset growth, partially offset by a twobasis point decline in net interest margin.

#### Notes:

- 1 Excludes impact arising from Citi Integration
- 2 Includes trade & remittances, guarantees and deposit-related fees
- 3 Net of interchange fees paid

First-half net fee income rose 25% from a year ago to \$2.09 billion. Wealth management fees grew 42% to \$1.05 billion driven by a shift from deposits into investments and bancassurance, and an expansion in assets under management. Card fees increased 32% to \$614 million from higher spending. Both wealth management fees and card fees benefited from the consolidation of Citi Taiwan. Loan-related fees and transaction service fees were also higher, rising 35% to \$371 million and 2% to \$459 million respectively.

These gains were moderated by a decline in investment banking fees.

Compared to the previous half-year, net fee income rose 22%, driven by strong increases in wealth management fees, card fees, and loan-related fees.

First-half other non-interest income rose 15% from a year ago to \$1.85 billion. Net trading income of \$1.73 billion increased 21% led by growth in treasury customer sales to both consumer banking and institutional banking clients, and included some non-

recurring gains. This was partially offset by a decline in gains from investment securities.

Compared to the previous half-year, other non-interest income was 19% higher due to increased net trading income and gains from investment securities.

#### Notes:

- 1 Excludes impact arising from Citi Integration and provision for CSR
- 2 Measured based on full-time equivalent. 1st Half 2024 and 2nd Half 2023 included staff count from the consolidation of Citi Taiwan

First-half expenses of \$4.25 billion were 11% higher than a year ago, with Citi Taiwan accounting for five percentage points of the increase. Staff costs increased 12% due to salary increments and higher bonus accruals, as well as headcount growth including the addition of staff from Citi Taiwan. Non-staff costs rose 10% led by higher revenue-related expenses.

Compared to the previous half, expenses were little changed.

The cost-income ratio was at 39%, slightly higher than a year ago and three percentage points lower than the previous half.

#### Notes:

- 1 Excludes impact arising from Citi Integration and provision for CSR
- 2 Refer to sections on Customer Loans and Non-Performing Assets and Loss Allowance Coverage for more information on business segments

The business segment results are prepared based on the Group's internal management reporting, which reflects its management structure. As the activities of the Group are highly integrated, internal allocations have been made in preparing the segment information. Amounts for each business segment are shown after the allocation of certain centralised costs, funding income and the application of transfer pricing, where appropriate. Transactions between segments are recorded within the segment as if they are third party transactions and are eliminated on consolidation.

The various business segments are described below:

#### **Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management**

Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management provides individual customers with a diverse range of banking and related financial services. The products and

services available to customers include current and savings accounts, fixed deposits, loans and home finance, cards, payments, investment and insurance products.

First-half profit before tax rose 11% from a year ago to \$2.35 billion led by higher wealth management fees and augmented by the consolidation of Citi Taiwan**.** Total income grew 18% to \$5.06 billion. Net interest income rose 10% to \$3.23 billion, boosted by net interest margin expansion and growth in loans and deposits. Non-interest income grew 36% to \$1.83 billion driven by higher fees from wealth management and cards. Expenses rose 22% to \$2.49 billion. Total allowances increased \$116 million to \$222 million from higher specific provisions.

Compared to the previous half year, profit before tax rose 9%. Total income was 8% higher. Net interest income eased 1% from a lower net interest margin moderated by volume growth. Non-interest income rose 29% from

higher wealth management fees and cards. Expenses were 5% higher, while total allowances were \$58 million higher from general provisions and specific provisions.

#### **Institutional Banking**

Institutional Banking provides financial services and products to institutional clients, including bank and non-bank financial institutions, government-linked companies, large corporates and small and medium sized businesses. Products and services comprise the full range of credit facilities from short-term working capital financing to specialised lending. It also provides global transactional services such as cash management, trade finance and securities and fiduciary services; treasury and markets products; corporate finance and advisory banking as well as capital markets solutions.

First-half profit before tax of \$3.33 billion was 6% lower than a year ago. Total income was stable at \$4.69 billion. Net interest income declined by 4% to \$3.42 billion from a lower net interest margin, partially offset by higher asset and deposit volumes. Noninterest income grew 13% to a record of \$1.26 billion, driven by higher loan-related and cash management fees and treasury customer sales. Expenses rose 12% to \$1.34 billion. Total allowances increased to a charge of \$21 million from a write-back of \$62 million a year ago.

Compared to the previous half year, profit before tax grew 3%. Total income was stable as non-interest income growth was offset by lower net interest income. Expenses were 4% higher, while total allowances fell \$129 million due to lower specific allowances.

#### **Markets Trading**

"Treasury Markets" was renamed "Global Financial Markets" (GFM) as part of a business reorganisation in first-quarter 2024. "Markets Trading" comprise the structuring, market-making and trading activities of GFM. It excludes customer sales income which is reflected in the Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management and institutional business segments under Commercial book.

First-half profit before tax fell 47% from a year ago to \$76 million. Total income was little changed at \$433 million as lower income from interest rate activities was offset by higher income from equity derivatives, foreign exchange and credit activities. Expenses rose 15% from higher staff costs.

Compared to the previous half year, total income rose 55% due to higher income from interest rate, credit and equity derivatives activities. Expenses rose 9% driven by higher business-related expenses.

Income from treasury customer activities which have been incorporated fully into Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management and Institutional Banking income rose 26% from a year ago to \$1.18 billion, due mainly to higher sales of equity derivative, credit, foreign exchange and interest rate products.

Compared to the previous half year, income from treasury customer activities rose 28% mainly from equity derivative, foreign exchange, interest rate and credit products.

### **Others**

The Others segment encompasses the results of corporate decisions that are not attributed to business segments. It includes earnings on capital deployed into high quality assets, earnings from non-core asset sales and certain other head office items such as centrally raised allowances.

#### **Singapore**

First-half net profit rose 10% from a year ago to \$4.24 billion. Total income increased 6% to \$7.15 billion from broad-based growth in net interest income, fee income and treasury customer sales. Net interest income increased 3% to \$4.62 billion on the back of balance sheet growth and a stable net interest margin. Fee income grew 18% to \$1.24 billion from higher wealth management, card and loan-related fees. Other non-interest income rose 10% to \$1.29 billion led by gains in treasury customer sales. Expenses increased 6% to \$2.46 billion mainly from higher staff costs. Total allowances fell from a \$102 million charge a year ago to a \$24 million write-back due to lower general allowances.

Compared to the previous half year, net profit rose 16% from higher total income and lower allowances.

Net interest income was stable despite sluggish loan demand. Net fee income grew 17% to \$411 million from broad-based growth led by wealth management. Other non-interest income increased 24% to \$234 million from higher wealth management treasury customer sales and trading gains. Expenses rose 9% to \$626 million led by higher staff costs and revenue-related expenses. Total allowances

increased from \$45 million a year ago to \$93 million due to higher general allowances. Specific allowances were lower than a year ago at 10 basis points of loans.

Compared to the previous half-year, net profit rose 4% due to higher total income and stable expenses and allowances.

### **Rest of Greater China**

First-half net profit rose 53% from a year ago to \$305 million mainly due to the consolidation of Citi Taiwan in August 2023. Total income increased 67% to \$1.02 billion from a 49% rise in net interest income to \$557 million and a 95% increase in non-interest income to \$461 million, boosted by the expanded Taiwan franchise. Treasury customer sales in the region were also stronger. Expenses increased 54% to \$648 million mainly due to the consolidation of Citi Taiwan. Total allowances rose from \$48 million a year ago to \$104 million mainly due to higher general allowances. Share of profits of associates increased 10% to \$100 million, including the impact of an increased stake in Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank.

#### **South and Southeast Asia**

First-half net profit rose 20% from a year ago to \$205 million. Total income grew 10% to \$780 million as increases in net interest income and net fee income were moderated by a decline in other non-interest income. Net interest income rose 13% to \$616 million driven by increased contributions from India and Indonesia. Net fee income grew 12% to \$154 million led by growth in India. Expenses were 2% higher at \$450 million. Total allowances rose from \$50 million a year ago to \$71 million due to higher general allowances, while specific allowances were stable.

#### **Rest of the World**

First-half net profit fell 5% from a year ago to \$213 million.

Expenses rose 14% to \$72 million. Total allowances increased from a \$12 million write-back a year ago to a \$39 million charge due to higher general allowances.

#### Notes:

- 1 Refers to expected credit loss
- 2 30 Jun 2024 and 31 Dec 2023 included impact from the consolidation of Citi Taiwan. Loans acquired from Citi Taiwan integration amounted to \$10 billion on 12 August 2023
- 3 Loans by geography are determined according to the location where the borrower, or the issuing bank in the case of bank backed export financing, is incorporated

Gross customer loans rose 3% or \$11 billion in constant-currency terms from a year ago to \$431 billion mainly due to the consolidation of Citi Taiwan which contributed \$10 billion.

Over the first six months, loans grew 1% or \$5 billion in constant-currency terms, led by increases of \$3 billion each in trade loans and non-trade corporate loans. Wealth management loans were also higher. These increases were moderated by declines in housing and other loans.

Asset quality continued to be resilient. The NPL ratio was stable at 1.1% over the six months as new nonperforming asset formation was offset by repayments and write-offs.

General allowance reserves remained prudent at \$3.98 billion. Total allowance reserves amounted to \$6.55 billion, resulting in an allowance coverage of 129% and of 227% after considering collateral of \$2.19 billion.

#### Notes:

Deposits grew 6% or \$32 billion in constant-currency terms from a year ago to \$551 billion, with the consolidation of Citi Taiwan accounting for one-third of the increase.

Over the first six months, deposits increased 2% or \$9 billion in constant-currency terms as Casa deposit outflows, which slowed from the previous year, were offset by an increase in fixed deposits.
