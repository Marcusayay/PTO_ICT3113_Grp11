# **Dividends**

2025. In the subsequent two years, it expects to pay out a similar amount of capital either through this or other mechanisms, barring unforeseen circumstances.

The Capital Return dividend is the latest in a series of capital management initiatives undertaken by the Board in recent years, which included regular increases in the ordinary dividend including through a bonus issue, occasional special dividends and a share buyback programme. The Board will continue to consider all forms of returning capital.

### **Full-year performance**

Commercial book net interest income rose 5% to SGD 15.0 billion from higher net interest margin and balance sheet growth. Net interest margin expanded four basis points to 2.80% due mainly to the repricing of fixed-rate assets. Loans increased 3% or SGD 12 billion in constant-currency terms to SGD 431 billion from non-trade corporate loans and trade loans. Housing and other consumer loans were little changed.

Deposits rose 4% or SGD 20 billion to SGD 562 billion in constant-currency terms. The increase was driven by fixed deposits in the first half of the year and by Casa inflows in the second half.

Commercial book net fee income grew 23% to a record SGD 4.17 billion. The increase was led by wealth management fees, which rose 45% to a new high of SGD 2.18 billion from broad-based growth in investment products and bancassurance, as well as the consolidation of Citi Taiwan. Card fees grew 19% to SGD 1.24 billion from the consolidation of Citi Taiwan and from higher spending. Loan-related fees

increased 16% to SGD 644 million. Transaction service fees were little changed. Investment banking fees declined 19% due to slower equity capital market activities.

Commercial book other non-interest income increased 21% to SGD 2.16 billion from record treasury customer sales and property disposal gains. Excluding the property disposal gains, commercial book other non-interest income grew 15%.

Markets trading income rebounded 27% to SGD 922 million as FX, interest rate and equity derivative activities benefited from market volatility.

Expenses rose 10% to SGD 8.90 billion, led by higher staff costs. Citi Taiwan accounted for three percentage points of the increase. The cost-income ratio was unchanged at 40% and profit before allowances grew 11% to a new high of SGD 13.4 billion.

Commercial book net fee income grew 12% to SGD 968 million. The growth was led by a 41% increase in wealth management fees. Card, transaction service and investment banking fees were also higher. The increases were moderated by a 11% decline in loan-related fees.

Commercial book other non-interest income grew 41% to SGD 548 million due to higher treasury customer sales and property disposal gains. Excluding the property disposal gains, commercial book other non-interest income was 19% higher.

# **Fourth quarter 2024 vs. third quarter 2024**

Net fee income fell 13% from seasonally slower wealth management activity and a decline in loan-related fees. Other non-interest income was 6% higher from property disposal gains.

Markets trading income fell 52% from the previous quarter's high base and seasonal factors.

For the group, total income was 4% lower. Net interest income grew 4% to SGD 3.73 billion, with net interest margin rising four basis points to 2.15% as lower funding costs and accounting asymmetry for markets trading more than offset the decline in the commercial book. Non-interest income fell 18% to SGD 1.78 billion due to seasonal factors.

Expenses rose 6% and profit before allowances was 11% lower.

### **Business unit performance**

fees, partly driven by the consolidation of Citi Taiwan. Institutional Banking income declined 2% to SGD 9.16 billion as higher loan-related fees, cash management fees and treasury customer income were offset by lower net interest income. Markets Trading income rebounded to SGD 922 million.

### **Balance sheet**

Asset quality was sound. Non-performing assets rose 4% in constantcurrency terms from the previous quarter to SGD 5.04 billion as new non-performing assets were partially offset by repayments and write-offs. The NPL ratio of 1.1% was little changed.

For the fourth quarter, specific allowances were SGD 229 million or 20 basis points of loans, while general allowances of SGD 20 million were written back. For the full year, specific allowances were SGD 559 million or 13 basis points of loans and general allowances of SGD 63 million were taken.

Liquidity remained ample with liquidity coverage ratio of 147% and net stable funding ratio of 115%, both above the regulatory requirement of 100%.
