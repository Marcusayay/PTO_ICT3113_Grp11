The context does not contain a line item explicitly labeled “Operating Expenses.”  
The closest figures available are the “Total expenses” and the “Expenses” line items, which are reported for the last three fiscal years.  Year‑on‑year changes are shown where the data allow.

baseline,"Calculate the Operating Efficiency Ratio (Opex ÷ Operating Income) for the last 3 fiscal years, showing the working.",8575.34,1122,5,,"**Answer**  
The only operating‑efficiency information available in the supplied excerpts is the cost‑income ratio for 2022, which is effectively the same as Opex ÷ Operating Income. No figures for 2021 or 2020 (or 2023) are provided.
