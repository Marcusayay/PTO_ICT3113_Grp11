The Net Interest Margin (NIM) for DBS Bank over the last five quarters is:

- **2Q 24:** 2.14 %
- **3Q 24:** 2.11 %
- **4Q 24:** 2.15 %
- **1Q 25:** 2.12 %
- **2Q 25:** 2.05 %

### Key Insights & Trends
1. **Stable but Slightly Declining Trend** – NIM hovered around the mid‑2 % range through 4Q 24, with a modest dip in 2Q 25 to 2.05 %.  
2. **Quarter‑to‑Quarter Variability** – The margin peaked in 4Q 24 (2.15 %) and fell by 0.10 % in the following quarter, indicating potential pressure from rising funding costs or a shift in the loan‑to‑deposit mix.  
3. **Consistent Performance** – Despite the recent dip, the NIM remains within the historical range for DBS, suggesting that the bank’s core interest‑earning operations are still healthy.  

These figures provide a concise view of DBS’s profitability from interest income relative to its interest‑bearing assets, a key metric for assessing a bank’s earnings quality.",data_marker\bench_react_agent_cfo.json,"Report the Gross Margin (or Net Interest Margin, if a bank) over the last 5 quarters, with values."
