This modest volatility suggests that while the bank’s core interest‑earning performance remains stable, it is sensitive to quarterly market conditions.\n\n**Citation Summary**\n\n- 2Q 24 NIM: [2Q24_CFO_presentation p.6]  \n- 3Q 24 NIM: [3Q24_CFO_presentation p.8]  \n- 4Q 24 NIM: [4Q24_CFO_presentation p.6]  \n- 1Q 25 NIM: [1Q25_CFO_presentation p.5]  \n- 2Q 25 NIM: [2Q25_CFO_presentation p.6]",
