The most pronounced drop occurred in 2Q\u202f25, suggesting potential pressure on interest income or a shift in the bank\u2019s asset\u2011liability mix.  \n3. **Strategic Implications** \u2013 A downward NIM trend may prompt DBS to review its pricing strategy, balance\u2011sheet composition, or risk\u2011adjusted return on assets to maintain profitability in a competitive banking environment.  \n\nThese figures provide a concise snapshot of DBS Bank\u2019s core profitability metric over the past year and a quarter, useful for investors, analysts, and internal stakeholders assessing performance trends.",
