In addition, we: - engaged our own specialists to use their models and input sources to determine an independent estimate of fair value for a sample of the Group's Level 2 financial instruments. We compared these to the Group's calculations of fair value to assess individual material valuation differences or systemic bias; - assessed the reasonableness of methodologies used and assumptions made for a sample of financial instrument valuations with significant unobservable valuation inputs (Level 3 instruments); - performed p",
